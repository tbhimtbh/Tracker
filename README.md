Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.

Enter the command python3 tracker.py to run the script.

The script will continue to run in the terminal until it is terminated manually or encounters an error.

You can run the script in the background by appending an ampersand (&) to the end of the command: python3 fb_profile_monitor.py &.

To check the running status of the script, use the ps command to list all running processes: ps -ef | tracker.py. The output will show the process ID (PID) of the script, which can be used to terminate it if needed.
